1. Set a saucepan with the milk to boil, over medium flame. When it comes to a rolling boil, turn the heat off and add the lime/lemon juice. Keep stirring with a spatula, to that the juice is evenly mixed and the chana/paneer separates from the whey
2. Drain this over a muslin cloth over a sieve. Wash the chana throughly with cold water to rid the acidity of the lime/lemon juice. Give the cloth a good squeeze, tie and set it aside for 30-40 minutes so that the remaining water can drain out. Check this video on how to make chana at home
3. When done, remove the chana on a plate and gently knead it using your palm until smooth and lump free. Divide it into equal sized balls and keep it covered until needed.

To make the dalna (curry)-->
1. Heat the oil, over medium flame until it smokes, then reduce the flame slightly and add in the chana balls. Fry until they get a light brown color on them, drain and set aside
2. Similarly, fry the potatoes with ½ tsp salt and ½ tsp turmeric until they get a light brown color on them. Drain from oil and set aside
3. Temper the remaining oil with cumin seeds, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaves and dried red chilies. Once they turn aromatic, add the hing and ginger paste and mix in well
4. Add in the turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder and chilli powder along with 3-4 tbsp hot water. Mix well and cook over medium flame for 3-4 minutes
5. Add the partially cooked potatoes, with ¼ cup hot water and mix in well. Cover and cook until the potatoes are almost cooked
6. Now add the tomato puree and cook until the oil separates. When done, lower the flame to minimum and add in the yoghurt (one spoon at a time) - quickly mix it in and add ¼ cup hot water
7. Increase the flame to a medium and let the curry come to a simmer. Stir in the salt, sugar, peas and chana/paneer dumplings 
8. Gently mix them in (and do a taste check), cover and cook for 5-7 minutes. Turn the flame off and add the chilies, garam masala and ghee. Swirl the pan around to gently mix. Keep covered for 5 minutes and then serve

You can serve your delicious chanar dalna (Bengali paneer curry) with pooris, pulao and even steamed rice. Enjoy!

9. 9. After 8 or 9 minutes, add the chopped palm jaggery to the milk. When adding jaggery, the temperature of milk can be 60 to 65 degrees C.
10. Mix very well till all the jaggery is dissolved.
11. Add ½ teaspoon cardamom powder. Mix well and let the milk become warm. After adding jaggery, the temperature of milk will reduce. So, you can check the temperature after adding milk.
12. 12. The milk should be warm – meaning if you dip your finger in the milk, your finger should feel comfortably warm, but not hot. If you have a cooking thermometer, you can check the temperature. It should be between 40 to 44 degrees C.
13. Now, add 2 tablespoons curd.
14. With a whisk, mix very well. The curd should dissolve in the milk. If you want you can even beat the curd before you add.
15. Now, pour the curd mixture in earthen or terracotta bowls, or earthen handi.
16. Cover with a lid or seal with aluminium foil.
17. Keep in a warm place for the Mishti Doi to set. Mishti doi takes longer to set than curd. The timing will also vary with the temperature in your city. Since its cool and not hot where I live, it took 23 hours for the curd to set. So, you keep for 9 hours to 24 hours.
18. When set, refrigerate and serve Mishti Doi as a dessert after your meals.

To prepare this popular South Indian recipe, wash rice and urad dal separately until the water runs clean and add fenugreek seeds to the rice. Soak it in water for 4-6 hours. Soak the urad dal too for the same amount of time. Drain all the water from the urad dal and grind it to a fine paste. Add water accordingly. Grind the rice to a coarse paste (add water as needed) and then mix both the pastes together in a large bowl and whisk them well. Make sure that the consistency is thick.

2. Now, the idli batter needs to be well-fermented. This step is very important to get soft and fluffy idlis. Keep the batter in a warm place to ferment. Once the batter has risen, add salt to it and whisk to mix it well.

3. Grease the idli stand with oil and take a ladleful of batter and fill the idli mould. Add ½ cup of water in the idli steamer and let it boil. Put the idli stand inside and close the lid. Let the steam build for 8-10 minutes before switching off the gas.

4. If you are using a cooker, use it without a vent and steam it for 10 minutes and then switch the gas off. In both cases, wait till the steam is released before you take the idli stand out. Wait for another 5 minutes and then use a sharp knife to scoop the idlis out. Serve warm with coconut chutney and sambhar.","1. 2 and 1/2 cup basmati rice

Masala Dosa is one of the most popular South Indian delicacies. To prepare the batter for Masala Dosa, wash and soak the rice (with fenugreek added into it) and urad dal in separate containers for approximately 6-8 hours. Once the rice and urad dal are soaked well, grind them separately in a mixer using the water in which they were soaked, till the mixture reaches a smooth consistency. Mix the batter of both the ingredients in a bigger container and add salt to it. Combine well and allow it to ferment overnight.

2. To prepare the filling of the dosa, heat 2 tbsp oil in a thick-bottomed pan and let the mustard seeds splutter. Then, add sliced onions, curry leaves, green chillies and saute them till the onions turn pink. Then, add a pinch of salt, turmeric powder and mix them well. Now, take the cubed potatoes and add them to the sauteed onions and mix them together. Pour water gradually into the mixture and allow the potatoes to simmer for around 4 minutes. When the mixture is in semi-thick state, turn off the gas and let it rest for a few seconds.

3. Now, take a dosa tawa and heat it on low-medium flame. Smear 1 tsp oil on it to prepare the dosa. When the tawa is hot, pour and spread the batter evenly in a circular motion.

4. When the colour of dosa's edges turns into brown, reduce the flame and sprinkle few drops of oil on the dosa sides and put 2 tablespoons of filling. Fold the dosa. Repeat the process until all the batter and filling is used up. Serve hot Masala Dosa with coconut chutney and sambhar.

Make sure you don’t overcook your pasta, you want it al-dente. Note: use only 1 cup pasta if you like more sauce in your pasta. While the pasta is boiling chop all the veggies.
2. Once the pasta is boiled, drain it using a colander and set aside.

Sprinkle 8 grams of salt and 3 grams of turmeric powder and toss to coat. Set this aside to marinate (in the refrigerator if it is a hot day).
Slice 100 grams of cleaned onions along the length. These will be used to make birista (fried onion).
Roughly cube 150 grams of cleaned onion and put it in the jar of a grinder.
Peel fresh ginger, chop roughly and add it to the same jar.
Grind the onion and ginger until smooth. Don't add any extra water during grinding.
Cube the tomatoes into small chunks.
Slit green chillies along the length.
Weigh the yoghurt, then beat with a fork until smooth.
Weigh out the dry spice powders in a bowl together—turmeric, cumin, red chilli, and Kashmiri red chilli.
Heat a kadai or a wok until very hot (250ºC). Pour all of the mustard oil (80 grams) and wait for it to start smoking. Once it smokes, lower the heat and wait for the smoke to subside and the oil to cool down a little.
Next, add the sliced onions from Step 3 and fry patiently until barely light brown. This should take about 6 minutes for this quantity of onions. Immediately strain and set aside. Remember, the onion will keep darkening due to residual heat even after you take it out of the oil. If it darkens too much it will turn bitter.
In the same oil fry the marinated fish in small batches. Fry the belly pieces (peti) separately from the back pieces (daga or gada). For a kalia, the fish should be nicely browned outside. Set the fried fish aside. We will cook the kalia in the same oil so that the sauce has the flavour of the fish.
Add ghee to the oil and wait for it to melt.
Lower the heat. Add dried red chillies, bay leaves, and whole garam moshla, i.e., cardamom, cloves and cinnamon, and finally whole cumin seeds.
Add the onion and ginger paste. Braise this until it darkens in colour and the moisture dries up.
Add the dry spice powders, stir and sprinkle a couple of tablespoons of hot water to prevent them from sticking to the pan and burning. Braise until the raw smell of the spices goes away (about 6 minutes).
Add the salt and the sugar.
Add the diced tomatoes and cook covered until softened. At any stage during the cooking add splases of hot water to prevent the spices from burning.
Turn up the heat, and add the beaten yoghurt stirring vigorously so that the yoghurt doesn't split.
When the oil (rogan) floats to the top, add the raisins and stir.
Once everything is well cooked, add 500 grams of boiling hot water.
When the sauce comes up to a boil, gently introduce the fried fish into the sauce. Also add the slit green chillies and the fried onions from Step 12.
Simmer the kalia until the consistency is like a sauce. A kalia should not be too thick. Plus, keep in mind that the fish will soak up a lot of the sauce and the gravy will thicken by the time you serve it.
Turn off the stove, sprinkle Bengali garam moshla and cover with a tight lid. Let this rest for at least half an hour before serving with plain boiled rice, or a polao.","600 g katla machh (catla or rohu fish)

This should make around 12 to 14 balls.In a deep pan or kadai warm the oil to deep fry the fritters.In a deep plate add half the milk. Chop the sides of the sliced bread and lay the bread slices one at a time, in the milk.Let the bread soak in the milk for a few seconds, then place it between your palms and gently squeeze flat till the milk is drained.Keep the slice as flat as possible so as not to break it.Now place the paneer mixture in the centre of the milk soaked slice, and bring the corners together to cover it with the soaked bread slice.Roll the fritter between your palms to make it a smooth ball. Sprinkle some semolina over it or roll it in a plate of semolina to encrust it.When the oil is warm, slowly slide the fritters into the kadai, taking care not to add too many and overcrowd the pan.Gently fry on a medium heat till the fritters are golden.Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and serve hot with Pudina Chutney as an appetiser or with Ginger Cardamom Chai to perk up your tea time.

Meanwhile grind the onion to a paste.
 
If you are using grated coconut also, then grind it once again in the mixer to a coarse paste.

Heat oil in Kadai/Frying Pan

Lightly fry the prawns so they turn golden in color, do not deep fry like other fish.

As soon as the prawns turn a pale golden take them out put them on a paper towel.

In the same oil, add the chopped garlic.

As soon as the fragrance of the garlic rises, take out the garlic from the oil so that the oil is now garlic flavored but there is no garlic in the gravy.

Add Bay Leaves

Coarsely pound the cardamom with a pestle and add them too

Add the onion paste when you see the whole garam masala crackling

Continue frying the onion with a little bit of sugar till it turns brown in color or the oil separates from the paste

Add the ginger paste and cook the masala.

Mix well and cook the gravy. The gravy tastes best when you simmer it a low heat for about 30-35 minutes. I have found that simmering the gravy with 5-6 fried prawns and a couple of the prawn heads adds a better taste to the gravy

When you see the oil surfacing on the gravy add the rets of the fried prawns. Sprinkle 1/2 tsp of Garam Masala powder and mix it in
Cook on low for some more time till the gravy thickens and acquires a creamy consistency. For a richer taste, finish off with a little ghee.

To make a delightful chicken biryani dish, firstly soak saffron in water to prepare saffron water (one tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup water). Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra water. Set them aside for later usage. Now, chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.
2. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. Then, add chopped onion to it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3 minutes. Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix. (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and patted dry before adding it to the dish)
3. Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned, coriander and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water and 1 tsp saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender. Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add the remaining saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now cook the dish without the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.
4. Cook for 15-20 minutes with a closed lid and garnish with 1 tbsp fried onions and coriander leaves. Serve hot chicken biryani with raita of your choice. Enjoy!
